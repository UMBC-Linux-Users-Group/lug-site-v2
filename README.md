## Contribution Guidelines {#contributing}

Please follow these as closely as you can! We appreciate you following these to
make development smoother as the project ages.

  1. Create a new branch in the LUG Repo, and develop your code locally.
  2. Stage your commit and push it up into the remote.
    - We try and ask that you follow [Conventional Commit Syntax (en ver)](https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)
    - It doesn't have to be terribly complex, we try and keep it uniform.
    - **Vague or Non-descriptive commits will be declined. Please keep this in mind!**
  3. Create a pull request in the repository and send it to the Project Owners or Developers.
    - See [Project Owners](#project-owners)
    - See [Developers] {#maintainers}
  4. Once you get your pull request approved, we will work to release it as soon as possible.
    - Please note that it may take some time if it is not a pressing issue, bug, or feature we want out.
    - However, we value all contributions. Please follow up with us if you have concerns.

## How Are Developers, Maintainees, and Project Owners delegated?
---

Currently most of our activities are in-person at UMBC. Note that a lot (if not all) people
Mentioned above can be found in the [UMBC Lug Discord](https://discord.gg/jgMqPtK2mg).

Please ask anyone mentioned in the [Core Project Members](#core-members) about joining the development team.
We appreciate more people helping through the lifetime of this project. However, we can't have a ton of people
with access so please understand it is not personal.

Maybe.
